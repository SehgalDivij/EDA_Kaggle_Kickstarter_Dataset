# Description

This is an Exploratory data analysis of the Kickstarter Projects Dataset on Kaggle(link)[https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects]

For the original kernel on Kaggle, refer to this (link)[https://www.kaggle.com/sehgaldivij/eda-analysis]

In this notebook, I did an exploratory analysis of the dataset, discovering trends across various categories in data by Plotting a Pie Chart of All Columns. This helped me understand at a very high level the general trend of all data points in each individual category.

In the end, I plotted a stacked bar chart showing proportion of projects in each individual category as a single point on the X-axis. The main takeaway from this chart was that most projects falling under the Dance Category were successful whereas most projects in the Journalism and then the Crafts Categories tanked.
